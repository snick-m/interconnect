# Interconnect
## Overview

Interconnect is an open-source initiative aimed at shedding light on the critical gaps in mental health services for racialized individuals with disabilities, especially those who have been impacted by incarceration. This project seeks to provide a platform where affected individuals can safely share their stories, connect with others, and build supportive communities. By leveraging collective insights and fostering open dialogue, we aim to improve understanding and advocate for better mental health resources tailored to the unique needs of these intersectional groups.

## Goals

Visibility: Increase awareness of the specific mental health challenges faced by intersectional groups, particularly those at the nexus of racial and disability identities.

Community Building: Foster a supportive community where individuals can find solidarity, share coping strategies, and offer mutual support.

Resource Hub: Compile and provide access to existing resources, research, and advocacy tools relevant to our community members.

Collaboration: Encourage contributions from developers, researchers, and community activists to enhance the platform's functionality and reach.
